* https://jestjs.io/en/

== Setup
* setup explained in https://medium.com/@nerdic.coder/how-to-use-jest-unit-tests-with-angular-87509b500158[How to use Jest unit tests with Angular], https://github.com/nerdic-coder/jest-angular-demo[complete code at Github]
* make Jest accessible in terminal: _yarn global add jest_

== Usage
* simply run all tests: _jest_
* run all tests and show only failing: _jest --silent_

== Features
=== Coverage
* jest --coverage

=== Watch Mode
* jest --watch
* looks for changes in background, runs tests automatically
* difference to Karma: Jest will only run tests on changed files -> faster!

=== Expect-API
* https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/docs/ExpectAPI.md

=== Mocking included
* https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/docs/MockFunctions.md

== Why to use Jest
* faster than Karma: Karma tests frontend in real browser, hence long startup time to build and start Karma server
* better output when failing test (including parts source code)
* needs less memory than Karma (only noticeable with hundreds of tests - however unexpected impediment later on)

== Best Practices
* always run watch mode
* with Angular: use Testbed
* keep away from DOM-testing (although Jest supports it)
